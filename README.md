# QuestLab
This repo is for both the final project of the class CPE 490 Information Systems as well as the Stevens' QuEST Lab.

**The project is a three part local area network to demonstrate multiple systems**<br>
**1.** A TCP server running on a Linux laptop that is looking for data to print to a terminal.<br>
**2.** A Zedboard, which is a development kit with a Xilinx Zynq-7000 all programmable SoC. This has a TCP client running on the processing system sending out random data over its ethernet port.<br>
**3.** Last is a second laptop that sniffs and alters the traffic going between the client and server. This is used to simulate a man in the middle attack of the data transfered between the TCP server/client conneciton.<br>
All three devices are connected to a single switch via RJ-45 ethernet connections.<br>
