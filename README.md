Code for Quest Lab FPGA Project and CPE 490 Final Project

The project is a three part local area network that connects a TCP server running on one laptop, a TCP client running on an FPGA development board, and a man in the middle on a second laptop that sniffs and alters the traffic going between the client and server. The three devices are connected to a switch via ethernet.
